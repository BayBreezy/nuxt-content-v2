# What is Routing ExpressJS

outing in Express.js is a powerful feature that allows developers to define and handle different routes for their web applications. In this article, we'll explore how to use routing in Express.js and provide some code examples to help you get started.

## Basic Routing in Express.js

The basic routing in Express.js involves defining routes for different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. You can define routes using the app.METHOD() functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method that you want to handle.

Here's an example of how to define a route for handling a GET request:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});
```

In this example, we're defining a route for handling a GET request on the root path ('/'). When a user visits the root path, the function inside the app.get() method will be executed, which sends the 'Hello World!' message to the user.

Similarly, you can define routes for other HTTP methods like POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. Here's an example of how to define a route for handling a POST request:

```js
app.post("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Got a POST request");
});
```

In this example, we're defining a route for handling a POST request on the root path ('/'). When a user submits a POST request to the root path, the function inside the app.post() method will be executed, which sends the 'Got a POST request' message to the user.

## Route Parameters in Express.js

Route parameters are a powerful feature in Express.js that allow you to capture values from the URL and use them in your code. Route parameters are denoted by a colon (:) followed by the parameter name.

Here's an example of how to define a route with a parameter:

```js
app.get("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User ID: ${req.params.id}`);
});
```

In this example, we're defining a route for handling a GET request on the '/users/:id' path. The :id parameter captures the value of the ID from the URL, and we can access it using the req.params.id property. When a user visits a URL like '/users/123', the function inside the app.get() method will be executed, which sends the 'User ID: 123' message to the user.

## Route Middleware in Express.js

Route middleware is a feature in Express.js that allows you to add functionality to your routes in a modular way. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the req and res objects, and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

Here's an example of how to define a middleware function:

```js
const myMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Middleware executed");
  next();
};

app.get("/", myMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});
```

In this example, we're defining a middleware function called myMiddleware() that logs a message to the console and calls the next() function to continue processing the request. We then apply this middleware function to the root path ('/') route by passing it as a second argument to the app.get() method.

When a user visits the root path, the middleware function will be executed first, logging the 'Middleware executed' message to the console, and then the main function will be executed, sending the 'Hello World!' message to the user.

## Conclusion

Routing is a powerful feature in Express.js that allows developers to define and handle
